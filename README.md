#  Data-Hill, the plutonium site prototype (as of 20th December, 2022).
a funny brick hill clone site prototype made in 11 days before the original release of plutonium on thedenbruh1.ct8.pl.
due to archive reasons and me scaring of getting a dmca takedown note, almost all games (except bits clicker) were removed.
